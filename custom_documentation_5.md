## [LookML Model](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-reference) Design

| Questions/Observations | Recommendations |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Are comments utilized appropriately throughout the views and model? | Comments should be utilized to provide information to other developers, such as the name of a person who made an update or the purpose of a particular field. They can also be used to identify different sections within the code. <br> <br> Comments should not be used to keep old versions of code and store old logic. If definitions have changed, it is best practice to simply remove the old code rather than just comment it out. <br> <br> Any autogenerated code that is not being used and any extraneous views or Explores should be deleted. |
| Are Explores organized across different Models for organizational purposes? | For Explore organization, utilize the [group_label parameter](https://docs.looker.com/reference/explore-params/group_label) within an Explore.  Utilize multiple models when data security needs to be applied through the use of [model sets](https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/settings/roles#model_sets). |
| How many Explores are present in each model? | Use the fewest number of Explores possible that allows users to easily get access to the answers they need. <br> <br> Consider splitting out Explores into different models for different audiences to limit the options available for each user group. The optimal number of Explores is different for every business, but having too many Explores tends to be confusing for end users. |
| Are any [datagroups](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/caching) present within the model? | Utilize datagroups for aligning PDT generation and Explore caching with underlying ETL processes. These can also be used in conjunction with schedules for pre-populating cache. It is best practice to set up a default datagroup at the start of a project that can be adjusted and applied as needed. |
| Are all LookML dashboards included in all models? | If all dashboards are included in all models, those dashboards may appear to users more than once (once for each model). Use specific dashboard references in [include statements](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-params/include) so that each only appears once. |
| Does the use of the [include: "*.view"](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-params/include) statement result in a large number of views being included within each model? | Including all views in a single model can slow performance. When a large number of views are present within a project, it may consider only including the view files that are needed within each model. |
| Are any custom number formats required? | Utilize the [named_value_format](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-params/named_value_format) parameter to set any custom formats within the model and then reference those using the [value_format_name](https://docs.looker.com/reference/field-params/value_format_name) parameter in dimensions and measures. |
| Are any custom map layers required? | Utilize a single file named [map_layers](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-params/map_layer) that can be included in multiple models or add json files directly to the repository and reference them within the model. |
| Are the [scoping](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-params/scoping) or [template](https://docs.looker.com/reference/model-params/template) parameters present in the model? | These should be removed.  They are no longer needed and have been deprecated. |
